Given the security levels TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, and UNCLASSIFIED
(ordered from highest to lowest), and the categories A, B, and C, specify what
type of access (read, write, both, or neither) is allowed in each of the following situations.
Assume that discretionary access controls allow anyone access unless otherwise
specified.

1. Paul, cleared for (TOP SECRET, { A, C }),
    wants to access a document classified
    (SECRET, { B, C }).

2. Anna, cleared for (CONFIDENTIAL, { C }),
    wants to access a document classified
    (CONFIDENTIAL, { B }).

3. Jesse, cleared for (SECRET, { C }),
    wants to access a document classified
    (CONFIDENTIAL,{ C }).

4. Sammi, cleared for (TOP SECRET, { A, C }),
    wants to access a document
    classified (CONFIDENTIAL, { A }).

(e) Robin, who has no clearances (and so works at the UNCLASSIFIED level),
    wants to access a document classified
    (CONFIDENTIAL, { B }).
