1. Introduction
2. Description
3. Code examples
  a. draw network diagram -> put it on microsoft paint. copy the test network diagram format  
  b. use network diagram again -> explain with backend authentication and discuss consequence for distributed systems
    
4. how to mitigate this issue?

For inbound authentication: 

* Rather than hard-code a default username and password, key, or other authentication credentials for first time logins, utilize a "first login" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password or key.

For outbound authentication: 
 
* store passwords, keys, and other credentials outside of the code in a strongly-protected, encrypted configuration file or database that is protected from access by all outsiders, 
including other local users on the same system. Properly protect the key (CWE-320). 

* If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible [REF-7].
In Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.
